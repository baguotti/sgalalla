# Documentation Rule

Every commit MUST be accompanied by an update to the following project documentation files:
1.  **docs/history.md**: Update the version table and detailed release notes.
2.  **docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md**: Add a new date-stamped entry describing the changes and their status.

Failure to update these files is considered an incomplete task.
